# Phylogenomics-of-Apocynaceae
This is the complete pipeline used to analyse Apocynaceae data, starting from scratch. It covers everything from renaming the raw data and counting the number of reads to generating the final phylogenetic tree, including coalescent and concatenation approaches. We also provide the scripts for downstream analyses and for plotting all the figures.

More details about this methodology can be found on the associated [wiki page](https://github.com/cassiabitencourt/Phylogenomics-of-Apocynaceae/wiki)
